The sinister forces trying to kill America have done everything they can to stop me,
to silence you, and to turn this nation into a socialist dumping ground for criminals,
junkies, Marxists, thugs, radicals, and dangerous refugees that no other country wants.
No other country wants them.
If those opposing us succeed, our once beautiful USA will be a failed country that no one will even recognize.
A lawless, open borders, crime-ridden, filthy, communist nightmare. That’s what it’s going and that’s where it’s going.
I used to say that we will never be a socialist country.
I said it oftentimes.
I said it once at the State of the Union address and people didn’t understand what I was saying.
But I’d shout it out loud and I was right because that train has passed the station long ago of socialism.
It never even came close to stopping, frankly.
